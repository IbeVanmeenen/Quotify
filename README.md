### What
Quotify provides custom css to beautify the Quojob UI. This can be done with the help of a browser-plugin that allows you to inject custom css.

### Getting started
- Download a browser-plugin that allows you to inject custom css (for example stylebot).
- Copy the css of the desired theme.
- Activate the css only for the Quojob url.

### Contribution

##### Git Flow
QuoJob works with [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).

For a contribution to cupcake, you need to follow the [following workflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow#initialization) with the addtion of a pull-request.

Example for adding a feature/bugfix/theme:
- Start from develop (make sure to pull first)
- `git flow feature start -your feature name-`
- `git flow feature publish -your feature name-`
- start making your changes (commit and push regularly)
- when done, make a pull-request from your feature branch to develop
- after the pull-request is accepted, do `git flow feature finish -your feature name-`
